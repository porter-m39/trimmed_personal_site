            <p> I'm a fifth year Math PhD student at the University of Massachussets Amherst, advised by <a href = "https://people.math.umass.edu/~baykur/"> Inanc Baykur</a>. I study low-dimensional topology, specifically 4-manifolds. I'm interested in Lefschetz fibrations, nonorientable 4-manifolds, and exotic smooth structures. </p>

                <h3> Some other stuff about me: </h3>
                <ul class=gap_below>
                    <li> I love to cook, and maintain an active <a href = "https://saltoholic.wordpress.com/" >food blog</a>. Currently, I'm taking a break from updating the blog, and instead am working on building a blog site from scratch using the Django framework. </li>
                    <li> I have a <a href = "https://github.com/porter-m39" >Github page</a>, where you can find some web development projects. My math research is also up there, but that stuff's top-secret, so those repositories are private. </li>
                    <li> Other hobbies include playing billiards and cheering for the Detroit Lions. I used to say that I enjoy road cycling, but that was when I lived in Amherst (where the roads are good). Now that I live in Boston (where the roads are bad), I've switched to running. </li>
